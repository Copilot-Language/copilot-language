[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Copilot-Language/copilot-language.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Copilot-Language/copilot-language)

Overview
========
[copilot-language](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-language) The
front-end of Copilot defining the user language.

Copilot is a stream (i.e., infinite lists) domain-specific language (DSL) in
Haskell that compiles into embedded C.  Copilot is similar in spirit to
languages like Lustre.  Copilot contains an interpreter, multiple back-end
compilers, and other verification tools.

Examples
=========
Please see the files under the Examples directory in the
[Copilot](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot) for a number of examples
showing the syntax, use of libraries, and use of the interpreter and back-ends.
The examples is the best way to start.

Installation
============
The Copilot library is cabalized. Assuming you have cabal and the GHC compiler
installed (the [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) is the
easiest way to obtain these), it should merely be a matter of running 
     
         cabal install copilot-language

However, we strongly recommend you install Copilot, which installs copilot-c99
and other packages automatically.  Execute

         cabal install copilot

Resources
=========
[copilot-language](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-language) is
available on Hackage.

**Sources** for each package are available on Github as well.  Just go to
[Github](github.com) and search for the package of interest.  Feel free to fork!
